# NgBook: Angular Reddit

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli)

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive/pipe/service/class/module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.

## Deploying

After building the application for production, i.e. `ng build --prod`, change to the `dist` directory, and deploy the 
application to the `now` server. [Now](https://zeit.co/now) can be downloaded with npm with the following command: `npm install -g now`.  
Then execute the `now` command in the `dist` directory. It will ask you for your email address, and verification of 
this email via your email client. Once done, execute the `now` command again. You will given a URL where your 
application is deployed to, i.e. `https://dist-mgqczlflbz.now.sh` I've tried this on my iPhone Chrome browser as well 
as my desktop. Works great.
